## Starship Prompt

All setup scripts install the [Starship](https://starship.rs) prompt for a consistent shell experience.
On Windows this is installed via winget using the `Starship.Starship` package ID.

## Fast CLI Tools

The setup scripts also install speedy alternatives for common commands:

- `ripgrep` for searching directories quickly
- `fd` as a faster `find`
- `bat` as a colorful `cat`
- `eza` as an improved `ls`
- `kitty` as a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator
- `yazi` as a modern terminal file manager
- `delta` for modern git diffs (also used in Lazygit)
  - diffs are side-by-side by default, while LazyGit shows inline changes

# Mac

## Custom Alt Tab

I use the 'Alt Tab' program for easy window switching.

Activate with footpedal + r. Navigate with arrow keys and space to select.

## Hammerspoon

Spotlight opens when the Cmd key is tapped by itself.

## Fluor

Automatically switches mode of fn keys per program. Important as keyboard macros use F... keys.

## Better Display

Allows increased brightness when viewing SDR content on an HDR monitor.

# Windows

## Config

```
- To get the Alt Tab switcher to work better
    - Go to Accessibility -> Visual Effects -> Animation effects & turn them off
    - Without this, moving to another tab requires waiting a split second.
- Set cursor blink rate to 0
- Set cursor thickness to 6
```

Yazi expects its configuration under `%AppData%\yazi\config` on Windows. These dotfiles create a symlink to `~/.config/yazi` so settings apply across OSes.

## Powershell 7

Use this since it's nicer than the default one.

## Visual Studio

```
- For Visual Studio use VSVim with the provided vsvimrc
- Using the plugin 'Peasy Motion' with the following settings:
- Allowed jump label characters: tsraneiodhgmplfuc,bjvk
    - (note this is optimized for Colemak Mod DH)
- Use a plugin called MinimalVS for nice fullscreen mode
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pavonism.minimalVS
- There is a plugin called 'Smooth Caret' which messes with the VSVim caret - make sure it's disabled
```

## Perforce

Ensure you set the correct environment variable to allow the diff to work:

```
P4DIFF="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" /Diff %1 %2

# Visual Studio Code

I'm using a few plugins:
- Vim
- Find it Faster (hooks into fzf, rg & bat)
- clangd for C++ language features
Extensions listed in `vscode_extensions.txt` will be installed automatically
when these dotfiles are applied. Custom keybindings are documented in
[`docs/vscode-keybindings.md`](docs/vscode-keybindings.md).

For remote development, install the **Remote - SSH** extension. Add your server
details to `~/.ssh/config`, e.g.

```ssh
Host devbox
  HostName server.example.com
  User you
```

Use the “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host…” command in VS Code to start a session.
```

# Keyboard

Run 'chezmoi update' with Kinesis Advantage 2 V-Drive connected & key bindings will auto sync.

I've had issues where the keyboard drive gets totally corrupted when syncing from Mac - so just stick to Windows.

For more detail see the 'Interaction' repo.

## Macro Bindings

```
build and run - Shift F2
find class - Shift F3
scroll up - Shift F4
scroll down - Shift F6
stop build - Shift F7
goto definition - Shift F8
open spotlight - tap Cmd
toggle eye mouse - Shift F10
toggle comment - Shift F11
```

## Platforms

Press Pgrm 1 to activate on Mac
Press Pgrm qwerty to activate on Windows

Note you should always leave the keyboard in 'Windows' mode as the bindings have been manually translated.

# Footpedal

The config for the footpedal is located under the savant-elite2 folder.

The pedal config:
- Left is Escape
- Middle is Left Click
- Right is Right Click

The method to open V-Drive is either:
- Flip the switch on the bottom of the pedal
- Hold the pedal down briefly while connecting to the computer (waterproof version)
