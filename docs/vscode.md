# VS Code

- Settings live under the `Code/` package.
- Extensions: list them one per line in `vscode_extensions.txt`.
- On apply/update, the script installs any missing extensions.

Tips:
- Sync is intentionally off; the repo is the source of truth.
- Use project-specific `.vscode/` as needed; keep global defaults here.
